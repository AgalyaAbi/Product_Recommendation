🛒 Grocery Product Recommendation System

📌 Project Description
This project is a simple Grocery Product Recommendation System built using the Apriori algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application. It helps users discover products that are often bought together based on historical transaction data.

 🚀 Features
- Identify frequently purchased product combinations.
- Generate product recommendations based on user selections.
- Simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Displays confidence scores for recommendations.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Programming Language)
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- MLxtend (Apriori Algorithm and Association Rule Mining)
- Streamlit (Web App Development)

📈 How It Works
1. Load Transaction Data: Preprocessed list of grocery transactions.
2. Apply Apriori Algorithm: Find frequent itemsets with minimum support.
3. Generate Association Rules: Based on support, confidence, and lift.
4. Streamlit App:
   - User selects one or more grocery products.
   - Recommended products are displayed based on association rules.

📋 Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Mlxtend


pip install streamlit pandas mlxtend
 📚 Future Improvements
- Add user login system for personalized recommendations.
- Improve UI design with images for grocery products.
- Allow multiple product selection to refine recommendations.
- Deploy the app online (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
